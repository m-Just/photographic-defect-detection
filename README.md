# Neural Photographic Defect Detection

## System prerequisites
- Python 3.6+

## Required python packages and recommended versions (generated by pipreqs)
- numpy==1.15.4
- scipy==1.1.0
- torch==1.1.0
- torchvision==0.3.0
- opencv_python==4.0.0.21
- Pillow==6.1.0
- tensorboardX==1.8
- easydict==1.9

## Dataset preparation
1. Flickr dataset (collected from Flickr Creative Commons 100M dataset)
2. HDR+ dataset
3. AVA, Adobe5K, HDR+ mixed dataset (optional)

## Pretrained model preparation
1. ShuffleNet
2. ShuffleNetV2 (optional)
3. Resnet (optional)

## How to train
`python train.py [--options]`  
For example usages please look at `scripts`, and for the explanation of options
just run `python train.py -h`.

## How to evaluate
`python eval.py [--options]`  
General usage: `python eval.py --model_name [model_name] --epoch 100 --use_averaged_weight --test_spearman --test_objective --test_subjective`
(You may want to set the path to spearman, objective and subjective testing set properly before running the script)

The summary scores are saved to `./results` by default, and detailed reports
are saved to `./reports`.

## Problems
The project is still under construction. Future plans include:
- [x] Conv-BN fusion
- [x] knowledge distilling
- [x] weighted loss
- [x] data augmentation
- [x] learning with confidence
- [x] mean teacher
- [ ] gradient tuning
- [ ] better logging system
- [ ] add more comments
- [ ] support multi-GPU training
